# Coordinate System

The graphics engine uses a right-hand coordinate system. For easier visualization, imagine with your right hand, your index finger is the forward vector (Z+), your middle finger is the right vector (X+), and your thumb is the up vector (Y+).



## World Vectors
|Direction|Axis|Unit Vector|
|-|-|-|
|Forward  | Z+ | 0, 0, 1 |
|Up  | Y+ | 0, 1, 0 |
|Right | X+ | 1, 0, 0 |
